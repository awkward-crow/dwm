# dwm

## background

This is a fork of version 5.8 of dwm from suckless.org. I made the fork some time ago and the original git history got lost somewhere along the way. It has a few additional features, see `roll` and `bubble` in `dwm.c` and is customised to suit the dvorak keyboard layout I use.

## appearance

`appearance.def.h` is a dark themed appearance.

## behaviour

Behaviour consistent with a (customised) dvorak keyboard is defined in the file `behaviour.dvorak.h`.

See the makefile for the handling of appearance and behaviour.
