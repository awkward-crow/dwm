# dwm

## next steps

 - tidy up keystrokes for floating and toggle, remove alt-shift-space
 - cmdline interface e.g. quit-dwm ??

## background

This is a fork of version 5.8 of dwm from suckless.org. I made the fork some time ago and the original git history got lost somewhere along the way. It has a few additional features, see `roll` and `bubble` in `dwm.c` and is customised to suit the dvorak keyboard layout I use.

## appearance

`appearance.dark.h` is a dark theme, `appearance.light.h` ... go figure. The dark theme is the default.

## behaviour

Behaviour consistent with a (customised) dvorak keyboard is defined in the file `behaviour.dvorak.h`.

See the makefile for the handling of appearance and behaviour.
